    <h2 id="conversation">Conversation</h2>
    <p>On various web functions</p>
    <p>Graphic Designer Menaja Ganesh discusses the impact of the internet and our web usage.</p>

    <p><b>What do you think is the purpose of the web?</b></p>

    <p>Despite the fact that the web initially used to be a huge suource for surveillance, I think its purpose has now exapanded to documentation and archival. However, it still remains to be a means of keeping track of people around the globe.</p>

    <p><b>How does the web impact graphic design?</b></p>

    <p>Designing for web and screens is vastly different from print media, and impact graphic design as it creates an entirely new experience of visual language and communciation. The web has removed a sense of tactility from graphic design, and renders experiences to be perceived mentally rather than physically.</p>

    <p><b>How has your view of the internet and how has your experience being online changed over time?</b></p>

    <p>It has def changed through the websites I use or used the most. From barbie.com to club penguin to twitter. It's pretty self explanatory.</p>
